# Final_Project_IANNsTF_WS22-23

Welcome the GitGuh repository that holds all the code for the final project of the course 'Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with TensorFlow' (WS 22/23) by Anneke Büürma (995025) and Carmen Amme (994813).

In this repository you will find:

- The following py. files containing self-written functions for data analysis and model training:
  - preprocessing.py: All functions related to any preprocessing.
  - roi.py: File holds all functions regarding roi definition.
  - rsa.py: All functions related to Representational Similarity Analysis.
  - pretrained_models.py: Functions that deal with images and layer activations.
  - pretrained_resnet50_keras.py: File that initializes the pretrained ResNet50 from the Keras library.
  - pretrained_vgg16_keras.py: File that initializes the pretrained VGG16 from the Keras library.
  - self_trained_model_training.py: Script for our self-trained CNN.
  - ourmodel.py: Class to easily read in our model with weights to do further analysis.
  
- a pdf of the Final Project Report
- a pdf of the Meeting Summary
- a video of our project presentation

This is a link to the Google Drive folder that holds the fMRI data, the NSD special100 images, the training data for our model and all other necessary data for this project. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q_SOJWm4U_diwAOS-K5ITq4StCRxFMOQ?usp=sharing

This is the link to the GoogleColab sheet that holds all the code to run the functions from the py. files. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lzurz4VYAnlwTW0IK9OfMJ1e4yvJ4pfB?usp=sharing 
Make sure to upload the py. files to GoogleColab before running the code. Also make sure to adjust the paths to the data.
